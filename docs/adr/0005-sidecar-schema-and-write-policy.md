# Sidecar schema v1: deterministic names, atomic write per mutation

The sidecar `<project-root>/.revu/<review>.json` is:

```json
{"schema": 1,
 "name": "…",
 "source": {"kind": "worktree" | "staged" | "range" | "file",
            "base": "…", "head": "…", "path": "…"},
 "created": "…", "updated": "…",
 "annotations": [ … ]}
```

`schema` is a flat integer, bumped only on breaking shape changes; a reader
refuses a version higher than it knows. Annotations are kept in ULID order —
ULIDs sort by creation time, so append order and sorted order agree and a
diff of the sidecar stays readable. Timestamps are ISO-8601 UTC. Annotation
records themselves are fixed by ADR-0003.

The Review name defaults deterministically from the Source — `worktree`,
`staged`, `main..feature` (with `/` sanitized to `-`), `file-<slugified
path>` — so invoking revu on the same Source *resumes* the existing Review
instead of creating a new one. The command prompts with the default; an
existing sidecar is loaded, never clobbered. Multiple concurrent Reviews per
Source stay out of v0.

Per ADR-0002 the sidecar is the state, not a flush: every Annotation add,
edit, or delete triggers an atomic write (temp file + rename), no debounce,
no explicit save. Reviews are small; a crash window would cost trust in "an
agent can read the file at any moment".

`.revu/` is personal working state in v0 (no `author` field, one reviewer):
documentation recommends git-ignoring it, and revu never edits the user's
`.gitignore` itself.
